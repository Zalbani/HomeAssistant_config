# Window sensor -> valve switch. When window opens (on), turn off valve. When closed (off), turn on valve.
# Add entries for each window that should cut its associated radiator.
# When adding a new window, also add its sensor to mappings/heaters/window_sensors.yaml.
#
# For valves with "open window" detection (e.g. SONOFF TRVZB), add open_window to reset it when window closes.
